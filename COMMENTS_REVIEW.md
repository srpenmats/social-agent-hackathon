**Tweet Text:**
> NIST just launched an AI Agent Standards Initiative for identity, security, and interoperability. AI agents are becoming eco…

**Comment Option 1** (Technical Insight) - Confidence: 8/10
> This is exactly what the industry needs. Standards for AI agent identity and security will be crucial as autonomous systems scale. Curious how this will integrate with existing agent frameworks.

**Comment Option 2** (Expert Endorsement) - Confidence: 7/10
> Great to see NIST taking the lead here. Agent interoperability without security standards is a recipe for disaster. Looking forward to contributing feedback during the public comment period.

**Tweet Text:**
> If you aren't vibecoding an AI security agent right now, what are u doing?

**Comment Option 1** (Practitioner Wisdom) - Confidence: 7/10
> Agent security isn't just about preventing malicious code—it's about verifiable behavior. The silent failures are what keep me up at night. Detection time = money lost.

**Comment Option 2** (Educational) - Confidence: 8/10
> Security for AI agents requires a different mindset than traditional software security. Behavioral monitoring, sandboxed execution, and rollback mechanisms are table stakes.

**Tweet Text:**
> zero-knowledge proofs for agent work verification is the missing piece everyone's been sleeping on. we don't need to trust agents did what they claim - we need cryptographic proof...

**Comment Option 1** (Technical Depth) - Confidence: 9/10
> Trust layers for autonomous agents are non-negotiable at this point. Without cryptographic verification of agent actions, we're just hoping for the best. Zero-knowledge proofs are the path forward.

**Comment Option 2** (Problem Framing) - Confidence: 8/10
> The trust problem is the bottleneck. Once we solve agent identity and action verification, the economy of autonomous agents can actually scale securely.
