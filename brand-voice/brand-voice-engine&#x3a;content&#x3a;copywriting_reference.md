## Do / Don't Pairs

### Cultural Engagement

| DO (On-Brand) | DON'T (Off-Brand) | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Inflation said 'we're all in this together' and I've never felt more personally attacked." | "Inflation is rising. Here are tips to manage your budget." | The first is witty and relatable. The second is a press release. |
| "This is the financial glow-up no one talks about." | "Great job on improving your credit score! #CreditBuilding" | Sounds human vs. sounds like a social media intern. |
| "The 3 stages of payday: 1) rich 2) bills 3) wait, where did it go?" | "Payday is a great time to review your budget. What are your spending goals this month?" | Relatable humor vs. boring financial advice. |
| "Budget tip: stop pretending 'I deserve this' isn't a line item." | "Remember to stick to your budget this week!" | Self-aware and funny vs. generic motivation. |
| "Your credit score isn't a personality trait. But it is a cheat code." | "A good credit score can help you get better loan rates." | Memorable and shareable vs. textbook. |

### Finance-Relevant Engagement

| DO (On-Brand) | DON'T (Off-Brand) | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Credit utilization under 30% is one of the fastest score moves you can make. The less you use, the more they trust you." | "Instacash gives you up to $500 with no interest! Sign up now!" | Adds value first. Sales pitches get ignored. |
| "The fact that you're even thinking about this means you're further ahead than you realize." | "Don't worry, MoneyLion can help! Download our app for financial tools." | Empathetic vs. opportunistic. |
| "Hot take: the best financial advice is 'know where your money goes.' Everything else is a footnote." | "Track your spending with MoneyLion's budgeting tools." | Thought leadership vs. product pitch. |
| "Direct deposit is the 'set it and forget it' of getting paid. Your future self will thank you." | "Set up direct deposit with RoarMoney to get paid up to 2 days early." | Helpful context vs. feature announcement. |

### Responding to Financial Stress

| DO (On-Brand) | DON'T (Off-Brand) | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "One step at a time. You're further along than you think." | "Have you tried Instacash? You can get up to $500 with no interest!" | Empathy first. NEVER pitch to someone in distress. |
| "The hardest part is starting. Everything after that is just momentum." | "MoneyLion has tools to help with budgeting and cash flow!" | Support the person, don't sell to them. |
| "Real talk: most people's finances are messier than they show online. You're not behind." | "If you're struggling, check out these financial resources from MoneyLion." | Normalize the experience. Don't brand the crisis. |
